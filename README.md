## 😎 About me

I started learning web development on my own for eight months full-time. Then decided to take the **Openclassrooms** web developer training course for nine months to validate my skills and learn new things. Especially by creating projects that meet the needs of the current market.
I usually work in vanilla javascript, but I'm always curious to learn new things that can improve my knowledge and possibilities in my working environment.

### 🎓 Openclassrooms - 2023

I completed the 9-month web integrator training course with Openclassrooms, which enabled me to carry out 12 projects in line with current business needs. <br>
This enabled me to confirm my knowledge and develop my skills. In particular, I was able to work on new concepts, find solutions on my own, learn about frameworks, state management, and API requests.
```javascript
const raphael = new Object();
function diploma() {
  if(raphael.diplomes > 0){
    return console.log("👨‍🎓 Intégrateur web - RNCP Niveau 5 (Bac+2)");
  }
}
```

## 👨‍💻 About my work

I've always been attracted to designing websites and their interactions. That's why I pay particular attention to animations, performances, and design in my projects. <br>
I like to create new experiences and ensure the perfect pixel layout to create the best possible user experience. <br>
I'm also committed to accessibility and SEO so that my projects are accessible to everyone and for everyone!
```js
function userExperience(userHappy) {
  if(userHappy){
    return console.log("Job done! ✅");
  } else {
    return console.log("Try again, do your best! 💪");
  }
}
 ```
